# Roadmap

Planned and in-progress work for **AI Meeting Notes** - the macOS app
(`packages/meeting-engine`) and the Windows app (`packages/meeting-notes-windows`).
Items are grouped by theme and roughly ordered by priority within each group.
Nothing here is started unless marked otherwise.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's already shipped.

## Known bugs

_None currently._

(Fixed: "processing bar showed on the wrong meeting" - 0.21.1 scopes the busy UI
to `controller.activeID == meeting.id`.)

(Fixed: "model stays in memory after processing" - 0.21.3 sends `keep_alive: 0`
so Ollama unloads the summary model right after summarizing; whisper-cli already
exits after each transcription.)

## Distribution & packaging

- ✅ **Developer ID signing + notarization + DMG.** Shipped (first signed release
  0.26.0). `scripts/make-dmg.sh --release` builds, signs with Developer ID,
  notarizes, staples, and publishes a GitHub release with the DMG - gated on
  `DEVELOPER_ID_APP` / `NOTARY_PROFILE`. Apple Developer Program enrollment is
  done; the public download opens with no Gatekeeper warning. Mac App Store stays
  ruled out - the sandbox forbids process-tap system-audio capture and shelling
  out to `whisper-cli`.
- ✅ **Check for a new version.** Shipped in 0.27.0. On launch (throttled to once
  a day) the app queries the GitHub Releases API for the latest macOS `v*` release,
  and shows a dismissible "Version X is available - Download" bar plus a manual
  **Check for updates** button in Settings → About. Privacy-safe: one outbound
  request, no telemetry, no auto-install (Download opens the release page).
  Possible follow-up: one-click download + auto-relaunch (e.g. Sparkle).

## Windows app (active)

A native Windows port in a new package `packages/meeting-notes-windows/`, leaving
the macOS app untouched. Full step-by-step plan: **[WINDOWS-PLAN.md](WINDOWS-PLAN.md)**.

- **Stack:** .NET 8 + C#, NAudio for capture, WPF UI (chosen over WinUI 3 so it
  builds on CI without the Windows App SDK workload).
- **Zero-setup system audio** via WASAPI loopback (`WasapiLoopbackCapture`) + mic
  via `WasapiCapture`, as two separate tracks - the Windows equivalent of the
  macOS Core Audio process taps, no virtual device required.
- **Reused logic (re-implemented in C#):** whisper.cpp transcription + You/Them
  two-track merge, Ollama/Claude summarization with map-reduce, Markdown note
  storage in the Obsidian vault. These are pure logic/HTTP/filesystem.
- **v1 = MVP:** record → transcribe → summarize → note (Phases 0-6 shipped:
  engine + WPF UI + in-app model download + self-contained packaging/installer).
  Diarization, auto meeting-detection, tray UI, and ETA are deferred (plan Phase 7).
- **Distribution:** the **Windows release** workflow (`win-v*` tag → publish → zip
  + Inno Setup installer → GitHub Release) is wired and green; the first build
  shipped as **win-v0.1.0** (unsigned beta, whisper-cli bundled), and the landing
  page has a Windows download. **Remaining: a real-hardware smoke-test** - the live
  WASAPI capture and WPF UI are CI-compiled but haven't run on Windows yet - then
  Authenticode signing (below).
- **Authenticode signing + SmartScreen (the notarization analogue).**
  The release workflow already signs the published `.exe`s and the installer when
  six repo secrets are set (`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`,
  `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`,
  `TRUSTED_SIGNING_PROFILE`); until then the build is unsigned and Windows
  SmartScreen warns on first run (the macOS Gatekeeper-warning equivalent). To
  enable, set up **Azure Trusted Signing** (~$10/mo, no hardware token, the modern
  path):
  1. In the Azure Portal, create a **Trusted Signing account** (the service is
     region-limited - pick a supported region) and a **certificate profile** of
     type **Public Trust**. Note the account's **endpoint URI**, account name, and
     profile name.
  2. Complete Microsoft's **identity validation** (individual or organization).
     This is the gating wait - like the Apple Developer enrollment - and can take
     a few business days; a new individual cert also carries no SmartScreen
     reputation until downloads accrue, so early users may still see a warning
     that fades over time.
  3. Create an **Azure AD app registration** (service principal) with a client
     secret, and grant it the **Trusted Signing Certificate Profile Signer** role
     on the signing account.
  4. Add the six values above as GitHub **repository secrets**. The next
     `win-v*` release then signs automatically via `azure/trusted-signing-action`
     - no code change needed.
  Alternative if Trusted Signing isn't available in your region: a classic **OV/EV
  code-signing certificate** (~$200-400/yr; EV gives instant SmartScreen
  reputation but needs a hardware token / cloud HSM) signed with `signtool` -
  would require swapping the signing steps in the workflow.

## Summary quality

- **Meeting category (1:1, daily sync, planning, …).**
  Add a `category:` frontmatter field (NOT `type:` - that's already
  `type: meeting`). Levels, in order of value:
  1. **Label only** - a dropdown (presets + custom) for organizing / searching /
     Dataview queries.
  2. **Per-category summary prompts** - the real win: tailor the summary to the
     type (1:1 → action items + growth notes; standup → updates + blockers;
     planning → decisions + owners; interview → candidate signals). Reuses the
     existing per-model prompt machinery.
  3. **Auto-detect** - infer the category from the calendar event title (once
     calendar integration lands) or via an LLM classification. Defer.

## Capture & product (the "Notion-grade" roadmap)

- **Product shape decided: the desktop app is the product; output is a folder of
  Markdown.** Obsidian is an *optional viewer* of that folder, not a dependency -
  see [NOTE-FORMAT.md](NOTE-FORMAT.md) (the output contract). The standalone
  Obsidian *plugin* (`packages/ai-meeting-notes`) is **deprecated** now that the
  apps capture with zero setup; it stays for the record but isn't developed.
- **Optional: read-only Obsidian companion (deferred).**
  If Obsidian-native querying is ever wanted, repurpose the plugin as a *read-only*
  client over the apps' output (no recording): dashboards, search, "re-summarize"
  via a small localhost API exposed by the app. Only worth it if in-app library +
  plain Markdown prove insufficient.
- **Real multi-speaker diarization** (phase 1 shipped in 0.23.0 as the
  experimental "Recognize speakers" toggle - see Completed). Remaining phases:
  - **Phase 2:** UI to **rename speakers** per meeting (and persist the mapping).
  - **Phase 3:** Auto-name from **calendar attendees** / LLM inference, once those land.

  Other follow-ups now that the pipeline exists: ~~let the user pin the speaker
  count~~ (done in 0.25.0 - per-meeting count, since auto-estimate proved
  unreliable on real audio), expose the clustering threshold, try a better
  embedding model (wespeaker over-split least in testing), and fold the mic
  "You" track into the embedding space so a remote echo of the user isn't
  counted as a separate "Them".
- ✅ **Native macOS notification on meeting detection.** Shipped in 0.28.0. A
  system notification ("Meeting detected", with a **Record** action) fires when
  another app starts using the mic while AI Meeting Notes is backgrounded/hidden
  (`UNUserNotificationCenter`); the in-app nudge still covers the foreground.
  Respects the "Suggest recording…" toggle, asks permission on first use, once per
  meeting.
- **Chat over meetings (RAG).**
  Ask questions across the meeting archive.

## Security & polish

- **Keychain for the Claude API key.**
  Currently stored in UserDefaults as plaintext; move it to the Keychain.
- **Add more meeting languages.**
  Keep **Auto-detect** as an option (decided - it stays). Expand the explicit
  language list in `meetingLanguages` beyond English/Ukrainian in a future
  release, so users can pin other languages for best transcription quality.

## Completed

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full shipped history. Highlights:

- ✅ **Map-reduce summarization for long meetings.** Shipped in 0.22.0.
  Transcripts over ~40k chars are split into ~24k-char chunks (fits even modest
  context windows), each summarized into partial notes (map), then combined into
  the final summary (reduce). Even coverage regardless of length, and smaller
  models can handle long meetings. The model is kept loaded between chunks
  (`keep_alive` during map) and unloaded after the final pass. Possible
  follow-up: recursive reduce if the combined partials themselves get large.
- ✅ **Per-stage processing controls.** Shipped in 0.24.0. Settings →
  "Processing steps" toggles for Transcribe and Summarize, each disabled with an
  inline note when its dependency is missing (no whisper model → no
  transcription; no local model / Claude key → no summary). Replaced the summary
  engine "None" option (migrated to the toggle).
- ✅ **Experimental mode + per-meeting speaker count.** Shipped in 0.25.0. A
  master "Experimental features" switch gates R&D features (off by default).
  Speaker recognition now lets you set the exact number of remote speakers per
  meeting (stored in `speakers:` frontmatter), since auto-detect proved
  unreliable on real audio.
- ✅ **Multi-speaker diarization - phase 1 (experimental).** Shipped in 0.23.0
  as the "Recognize speakers" toggle. Runs sherpa-onnx (segmentation + speaker
  embeddings + clustering, native/offline) on the **system track** and relabels
  whisper's segments by time overlap into `Them 1 / Them 2 / …`; the mic track
  stays "You". Off by default; the toggle is disabled until the binary + ONNX
  models are installed (`scripts/setup-diarization.sh`), bundled into the app
  when present. Threshold-based clustering auto-estimates the speaker count.
  Remaining phases (rename UI, calendar/LLM auto-naming) are under Capture &
  product.
- ✅ **Tighter Obsidian note integration.** Shipped in 0.17.0. Notes now
  embed both audio tracks (`![[… .mic.wav]]` / `… .system.wav`) in an Audio
  section so Obsidian shows inline players, and carry `tags: [meeting]` for
  querying (alongside the existing `type: meeting`). The app hides the Audio
  section (it accesses recordings directly). Possible follow-up: auto-fill a
  `participants` field once real speaker identification exists.
- ✅ **Estimate transcription time (ETA).** Shipped. An up-front estimate from
  audio length × a **learned per-model end-to-end rate** (self-calibrating EMA,
  seeded by model size), shown counting down in the record panel and the meeting
  processing bar - covers transcription *and* the opaque summary phase. Replaced
  the 0.18.0 progress-extrapolation ETA, which couldn't see the summary phase.
  Rates persist in UserDefaults (`procRate.<model>`).

## Postponed

_None currently._

(The **Windows app** moved from Postponed to active - see the "Windows app"
section above and [WINDOWS-PLAN.md](WINDOWS-PLAN.md). Decided on a Windows-native
.NET/C# app rather than a cross-platform Tauri rewrite, to avoid re-doing the
mature macOS app and to use NAudio's strong WASAPI loopback support.)
